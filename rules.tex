				\end{legallist}
								            
				\item \textbf{Timing}
				\begin{legallist}
					\item The following timing methods are accepted, but transponder time will take priority if more than one time is available for a given lap:
					\begin{longtable}{l r} 
                        \toprule

					\item If a driver participates in multiple run groups, they must declare in advance which run group will be used for official timing. Please declare which run group will be used for timing on your event registration form if you sign up for multiple run groups.
										                
					\item If a driver participates in a dedicated 86 Challenge run group, their timing will be taken exclusively from that run group.
				\end{legallist}
								            
				\item \textbf{Classes}
				\begin{legallist}
					\item Cars will be classed according to rules and modification points listed in the following sections.

					\item Prior to a driver’s first event of the season, they may declare to run in a higher class than their modification points would normally dictate.
					\item A driver shall not compete in more than one class during an event.
					\item If a driver modifies their car mid-season and moves up or down a class, the points earned in the previous class will NOT be carried over to the new class. Drivers may choose to not earn points in the new class and keep the points in the previous class.  Drivers participating in the GT Radial Championship Prize challenge cannot change classes.
