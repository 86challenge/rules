+ #heading[General Rules]
  + Chassis must be one of the following (hereafter referred to by its _Designation_):
    #table(
      columns: 2,
      align: (left, center),
      table.header(
        [Chassis],
        [Designation],
      ),

      [
        - 2012–2016 Scion FR-S
        - 2012–2020 Subaru BRZ
        - 2017–2020 Toyota 86
      ],
      [Gen. 1],

      [
        - 2022+ Subaru BRZ
        - 2022+ Toyota GR86
      ],
      [Gen. 2],
    )

  + *GT Radial Sponsorship*
    + Participation in GT Radial Championship Cash Prize and tire contingency are optional and require submitting #link("https://86challenge.us/documents")[registration forms] directly to GT Radial
    + Participants in the Championship Cash Prize and tire contingency must display 1 large GT Radial decal on the windshield and display 2 smaller GT Radial decals, one on each side of their car

  + *Timing*
    + The following timing methods are accepted, but transponder time will take priority if more than one time is available for a given lap:
      #table(
        columns: 2,
        align: (left, center),
        table.header(
          [Timing Method],
          [Time Penalty (s)],
        ),

        [Official timing transponder], [0.0],
        [Data logger with at least 10Hz GPS (e.g. Aim Solo 2)], [0.2],
        [Data logger with at least 1Hz GPS (e.g. iPhone)], [0.5],
        [Onboard video (first event only)], [0.5],
      )
    + If a driver participates in multiple run groups, they must declare in advance which run group will be used for official timing. Please declare which run group will be used for timing on your event registration form if you sign up for multiple run groups.
    + If a driver participates in a dedicated 86 Challenge run group, their timing will be taken exclusively from that run group.

  + *Classes*
    + Cars will be classed according to rules and modification points listed in the following sections.
    + A car may be used in multiple classes if driven by different drivers. Please comment on your event registration form if you are co-driving a car and what group you are driving in.
    + Prior to a driver’s first event of the season, they may declare to run in a higher class than their modification points would normally dictate.
    + A driver shall not compete in more than one class during an event.
    + If a driver modifies their car mid-season and moves up or down a class, the points earned in the previous class will NOT be carried over to the new class. Drivers may choose to not earn points in the new class and keep the points in the previous class. Drivers participating in the GT Radial Championship Prize challenge cannot change classes.

  + *Scoring*
    + Championship points are awarded at the end of each event according to the chart below:
      #table(

    + At the end of the season, the driver with the most points from 7 of the best scores out of 10 events wins the championship.

  + *In-season rule changes*
    + Changes which make the rules more _restrictive_ will be announced 60 days ahead of enforcement
