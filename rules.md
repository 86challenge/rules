    1. Official timing transponder times will take priority if more than one time is available for a given lap. If more than one GPS time is available, the GPS device with the higher update frequency will be used.

1. **Run Groups**

    1. If a driver participates in multiple run groups, they must declare in advance which run group will be used for official timing. Please declare which run group will be used for timing on your event registration form if you sign up for multiple run groups.

1. **Classes**  
    1. Cars will be classed according to rules and modification points listed in the following sections.  
    1. A car may be used in multiple classes if driven by different drivers. Please comment on your event registration form if you are co-driving a car and what group you are driving in.
    1. Prior to a driver’s first event of the season, they may declare to run in a higher class than their modification points would normally dictate.
    1. A driver shall not compete in more than one class during a single event.
    1. If a driver modifies their car mid-season and moves up or down a class, the points earned in the previous class will NOT be carried over to the new class.
